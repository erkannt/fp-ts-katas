## Practice fp-ts patterns by making tests pass

This is a work in progress. No idea if it is helpful.

`npm install` and then:

1. Run `npx just`
2. See compiler and/or tests fail
3. Write an implementation inside the test file
4. GOTO step 1

The `possible-solutions` branch contains code that passes the compiler and tests.

To run a single kata: `npx just kata=pattern-that-matches-kata-name`
